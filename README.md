# Randorbmizer

This is a mod for Peglin that causes your deck to consist of random orbs after every reload.

This mod is imperfect and comes with no warranties. It may break your game, prevent you from creating new savefiles,
crash your computer, or set your house on fire. It will add orbs to your deck that aren't meant to be used yet, 
and they may not work as you expect them to. 

## Installation guide

1. Install the BepInEx modloader according
   to [this guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/unity_mono.html)
2. Download the PeglinRandorbmizer.dll file [from the latest release](https://github.com/bo0tzz/Randorbmizer/releases/latest)
3. Place PeglinRandorbmizer.dll in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder, inside the game folder
