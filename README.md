# Randorbmizer

This is a mod for Peglin that randomizes the game. 
It will give you random orbs and random relics. You can disable both of those in the config. 

It will add orbs to your deck that aren't meant to be used yet,
and they may not work as you expect them to. The relics may bug out and not get removed properly.

This mod is imperfect and comes with no warranties. It may break your game, prevent you from creating new savefiles,
crash your computer, or set your house on fire.
